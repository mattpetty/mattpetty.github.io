Hi! I'm Matt Petty, a network engineer in Knoxville, TN, with over 10 years experience in non-profit healthcare IT. My primary experience is with Cisco gear, particulary [ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_ASA) and ~~Sourcefire~~ ~~Firepower~~ [Secure Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcefire), and many other Cisco acronym soups (AnyConnect, ISE, IOS/NX-OS, WLC, even a little DNA and ACI). However, I'm also something of an Apple fanboy, a general Unix/Linux hobbyist, open-source curious, and a longtime "small computing" enthusiast (i.e. the [ASUS Eee PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC), [Marvell Sheevaplug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheevaPlug), [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org), [1L computing](https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/), etc).

Up until I discovered the concepts of DevOps and infrastructure-as-code, my coding journey had always been a side hobby, tinkering with Perl, PHP, HTML, and Javascript, but for the last few years I've been attempting to learn Python, network automation, and modern infrastructure tooling to take my network engineering skills to the next level. Now, I'm finally ready to start documenting the journey here on this blog. Thanks for visiting!
